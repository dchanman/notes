    "    * Since interrupts are now forced to take place in user mode, this implies some process is running when an interrupt occurs\n",
    "    * Therefore, that interrupt, from the perspective of the kernel, can be considered to be coming from that process just like a trap (ie. software interrupt)\n",
    "    * Everything now looks the same. Interrupts, faults, traps all come from userland from a process. We can now all take the same generic first steps in the dispatcher"
