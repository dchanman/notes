    "# Data Cubes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Marginals\n",
    "* 4-dimentional **Sales** cube includes the sum of *price* over each bar, beer, drinker, and time unit (eg. days)\n",
    "* It would also include sum of *price* over all bar-beer pairs, all bar-drinker-day typles **each of which are a *group-by* query with some aggregate functions**\n",
    "* Similar comments apply to the *gratuity* data\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a cube contains multiple measures\n",
    "* Data warehouses may contain multiple cubes\n",
    "* Each cube has facts and dimensions\n",
    "* Can be organized in tables (*ROLAP*) or multidimensional storage (*MOLAP*)\n",
    "    * *ROLAP* can use star or snowflake schema\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of the Cube\n",
    "Dimensions have different members (eg. bars, drinkers, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Members are organized in a hierarchy\n",
    "* bars into cities, cities into states, etc.\n",
    "* beers into manufacturers, manufacturers into countries\n",
    "Some dimensions may permit multiple hierarchies:\n",
    "* days into months, months into quarters; days also into weeks, etc.\n",
    "These hierarchies alow us to visualize data at multiple granularities\n",
    "* eg. the sales of all Czech beers in Joe's bar during Q2 of 2014\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregation\n",
    "**Drill-down** is to *de-aggregate* data  \n",
    "**Roll-up** is to *aggregate* data along one or more dimensions\n",

    "\n",
    "Bar        | Jim | Bob | Mary\n",
    "-----------|-----|-----|-----\n",
    "Joe's Bar  | 45  | 33  | 30\n",

    "#### Example\n",

    "* `Sales(*pid, *timeid, *locid, sales)`\n",
    "* `Profits(*pid, *timeid, *locid, profit)`\n",

    "* eg. fixed attribute values (November always has 30 days, leap years are known, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful OLAP functions:\n",
    "* eg. durations/timespans, fiscal years, calendar years\n",

    "## Modelling of Dimensions\n",
    "Two main models:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Star Schema: table per dimension\n",
    "* simplicity \n",
    "* easier to formulate queries (one join per dimension, AKA **star join**)\n",
    "* poor modelling capabilities: what if dimension hiearchy is unbalanced or heterogenous?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snowflake schema: table per level of hierarchy per dimension\n",
    "* more flexiblity than star, more encapsulation of data in each table\n",
    "* heterogenous dimension hierarchies still problematic\n",
    "* query formations more complicated, more joins/dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Time(timeId, dayId, monthId, date).\n",
    "Time1(dayId, day-of-week).\n",
