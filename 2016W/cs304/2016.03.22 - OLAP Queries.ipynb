    "# OLAP Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Common operation: **aggregate** - measure over one or more dimensions\n",
    "* eg: total sales for each city, top 10 products in NorthEast, top performing employee per region\n",
    "\n",
    "**Roll up** is aggregating different levels together\n",
    "* from total sales by city, roll-up gets us sales by state. Rollup again gets us sales by country\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison with SQL Queries\n",
    "Result of join:\n",
    "* does not lose tuples\n",
    "* does not produce duplicate tubles\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cube Operator\n",
    "We have $2^k$ SQL `GROUP BY` queries that can be generated by pivoting on a subset of dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do a bunch with `CUBE BY`\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CUBE BY pid, locid, timeid SUM Sales\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Equivalent to rolling up Sales on all eight subsets of the set [pid, locid, timeid]\n",
    "* Each rollup corresponds to a SQL query\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT ..., SUM(S.Sales)\n",
    "FROM Sales S\n",
    "GROUP BY grouping-list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "CUBE allows us to efficiently compute multiple granularity aggregates\n",
    "* However it is expensive and computation is large\n",
    "* CUBE may be *partially* or *fully materialized* or not even at all\n",
    "* Lots of interest in computing it fast, compressing it, approximating it\n",
    "\n",
    "# Views and Decision Support\n",
    "OLAP queries are typically aggregate queries\n",
    "* precomputation is essential for interactive response time\n",
    "* CUBE is a collection of aggregate queries, so it's important we precompute as much as we can\n",
    "* Think of **warehouses** as a collection of asynchronously replicated tables and periodically maintained views\n",
    "\n",
    "## Issues in View Materialization\n",
    "* Which views should we materialize? What indexes should we build on precomputed results\n",
    "* Given a query and a set of materialized views, can we use the views to answer the query?\n",
    "* How frequently should we refresh materialized views? (to keep them consistently)\n",
    "* How can we refresh incrementally?\n",
    "    * Naive: throw away old view, recompute the new view\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "* **Top N Queries**: You would want to avoid recomputing the costs for all cars before sorting to determine 10 cheapest\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "OPTIMIZE 10 ROWS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Online Aggregation**: Can we provide user some information as we're computing before the final result is completed?\n",
    "    * eg. *Find average sales by state*: we can provide a \"running\" average as we're computing. Even with 2000 records, we're fairly close enough to the final result.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# SQL Server Management Studio\n",
    "* Integrated environment supporting\n",
    "    1. SQL server for relational and OLAP dbs\n",
    "    2. SQL Server Integration Services for:\n",
    "        * db service utils, extract-transform-load operations\n",
    "    3. SQL Server Analysis Services\n",
    "        * data warehouses and OLAP\n",
    "        * metadata as XML\n",
    "        * multidimentional expressions\n",
    "        \n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "* Datra warehousing/OLAP is an emerging and rapidly growing subarea of dbs\n",
    "    * \"business intelligence\"\n",
    "    * OLAP vs OLTP differs in important ways\n",
    "* Data warehouses are large, consolidated data repos\n",
    "* Data warehouses exploit sophisticated analysis techniques: complex multidimensional queries\n",
    "    * influenced by SQL and spreadsheet\n",
    "* Important data management issues for DW/OLAP are\n",
    "    * Semantic integration (different units, table layouts, etc)\n",
    "    * Heterogenous sources\n",
    "    * etc.\n",
    "* Data warehouses contain fact tables and dimension tables\n",
    "    * fact tables connect to dim tables via FKs\n",
    "* Star schema more common than Snowflake\n",
    "* Vendors have developed sophisticated engines that work with regular dbs to create data warehouses supporting OLAP"
