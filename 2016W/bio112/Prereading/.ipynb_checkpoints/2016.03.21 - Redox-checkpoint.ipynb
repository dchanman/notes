    "\n",
    "## Cellular respiration occurs in four stages\n",
    "\n",
    "Four stages:\n",
    "1. **Glycolysis**: `glucose -> pyruvate`\n",
    "2. `pyruvate -> acetyl-CoA + CO2`\n",
    "3. **Citric acid cycle**: `acetyl-CoA` further broken down, more $CO_2$ released\n",
    "    * these first three steps creates ATP and **electron carriers**\n",
    "4. **Oxydative phosphorylation**: electron carriers donate high energy electrons to **electron transport chains (respiratory chains)**\n",
    "    * Oxygen is the last acceptor, so oxygen is consumed and water is produced.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In eukaryotes:\n",
    "* glycosis in cytoplasm\n",
    "* citric acid cycle + oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria\n",
    "* electron transport chain in proteins inside mitochondrial membrane\n",
    "\n",
    "In eukaryotes:\n",
    "* reactions in cytoplasm\n",
    "* electron transport chain in plasma membrane\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cellular respiration involves a series of redox reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Oxidation-reduction reactions** are used to store and release chemical energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Oxidation** loses electrons  \n",
    "**Reduction** gains electrons  \n",
    "Both always occur in a single redox reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "In many biological systems, electrons are not completely transferred. Rather, *redox involves increases/decreases in electron density* where electrons are *partially lost/gained*\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a `C-C` bond becoming a `C=O` bond is an decreased electron density (oxidation). A `O=O` bond becoming a `H-O` bond is an increase in electron density (reduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Oxidizing agents** are **electon aceptors**  \n",
    "**Reducing agents** are **electron donors**  \n",
    "Note how these definitions are kinda flipped from redox above.\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_6H_{12}O_6$ is reduced to $CO_2$  \n",
    "$CO_2$ is oxidized to $H_2O$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chemical energy is stored in reduced molecules such as carbohydrates and lipids\n",
    "Carbs and lipids have a lot of energy because `C-C` and `C-H` bonds have high potential energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy is released gradually in cellular respiration. Glucose is oxidized slowly through many reactions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Electron carriers contain chemical energy in the form of high-energy electrons, which can be harnessed to produce ATP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Electron carriers transport high-energy electrons\n",
    "Electron carriers have two forms: (oxidized/reduced)\n",
    "* **nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide** ($NAD^+ / NADH$)\n",
    "* **flavin adenine dinucleotide** ($FADH/FADH_2$)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## ATP is generated by substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation\n",
    "**Substrate-level phosphorylation** is a a way of generating ATP\n",
    "* phosphorylated organic molecule directly transfers phosphate to ADP\n",

    "**Oxidative phosphorylation** is the common way of generating ATP\n",
