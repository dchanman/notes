    "    * O(number of digits of binary representation of n) = $O(logn)$\n",
    "* Union\n",
    "    * Notice how two binomial treesof order *k* can be combined to form a binomial tree of order *k+1*\n",
    "    * Pick one tree as the larger tree and the other as a smaller tree. Combine their trees\n",
    "    * Notice how you'll have to \"carry over\" trees if needed\n",
    "    * The amount of work is the same as doing binary addition on two numbers\n",
    "    * This is done in $O(logn)$\n",

    "    * However, a better bound would be $O(n)$"
