    "# Synchronous metadata updates\n",
    "**Problem**: Some updates to metadata require synchronous writes\n",
    "* data needs to \"hit the disk\" before anything else can be done\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "* creating a file: must write new file inode to disk before the corresponding directory entry\n",
    "* deleting a file: must clear the directory entry before marking inode as \"free\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to be able to survive a crash at any time between atomic operations\n",
    "* Issue here is that we have two components that can fail independently: disk and processor\n",

    "## Cyclic Dependency\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "* Both inodes in the same disk block (Block 2)\n",
    "* Both file create and file delete have occurred in the cache, but neither have hit the disk\n",
    "\n",
    "What order do we write the disk blocks out?\n",
    "* Block 1 is the directory inode\n",
    "* The `file create` depends on Block 2 being written before Block 1\n",
    "* The `file delete` depends on Block 1 being written before Block 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Soft Updates\n",
    "* Write at a finer granularity\n",
    "* Roll back one of the operations, write the other\n",
    "* Then write the rolled back operation\n",
    "* in other words, do 4 writes: eg. Block 2 for create, Block 1 for create, Block 1 for delete, Block 2 for delete\n",
    "* Performance is good enough, comes close to idealized"

    "## Overview\n",
    "Treat entire disk as **one big append-only log** for writes\n",
    "* Don't lay out blocks\n",
    "* Whenever a file write occurs, append to end of log\n",
    "* When file metadata changes, append to end of log\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect pending writes in memory and stream out in one big write\n",
    "* Maximize disk bandwidth\n",
    "* No extra disk seeks required\n",
    "\n",
    "Actual writes occur when\n",
    "* user calls `sync()` or `fsync()` and explicitly syncs the filesystem\n",
    "* OS needs to reclaim dirty buffer cache pages\n",
    "\n",
    "This was supposed to reduce seeking\n",
    "* Main memories were getting larger, we can cache more things\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing the log\n",
    "\n",
    "Each log write updates the inode\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inode map\n",
    "How do you find the inodes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use an **inode map**, which maps file number to its location of its inode in the log\n",
    "* inode map also in log\n",
    "* cache inode map in memory for perfromance (in fixed checkpoint region)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading from LFS\n",
    "File is scattered all over the disks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic assumption: Buffer cache will handle most writes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Log Cleaner\n",
    "Eventually the disk fills up, we need to reclaim dead space\n",
    "* eg. deleted files, overwritten file blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "We do periodic log cleaning\n",
    "* scan log, look for deleted or overwritten blocks (clear out stale log entries)\n",

    "When does the cleaner run?\n",
    "* when the disk is idle\n",
    "* this is shitty if the system is never idle lol\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning a segment requires reading the whole segment!\n",
    "* can reduce cost if data is already in cache\n",
    "\n",
    "How does segment size affect performance?\n",
    "* Large segments amortize access/seek time to read/write entire segment during cleaning\n",
