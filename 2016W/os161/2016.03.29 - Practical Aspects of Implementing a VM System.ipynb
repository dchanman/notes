    "### Kernel scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine this stack:\n",
    "* `foo()`\n",
    "* `kmalloc()`\n",
    "* `getpages()` - **spinlock the coremap**\n",
    "* evict, write to swap, wait on IO - **can't wait while holding spinlock!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the kernel can't evict the page. You could have a spinlock anywhere in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Recall if you took a spinlock, you've disabled interrupts. If you go wait on IO, you won't be able to receive the signal. OS161 asserts if you try to sleep with a spinlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation only occurs really if you realize that all pages are occupied and all pages are dirty. If a clean page existed, we can just chuck it and replace it with our own page. We can make this messy scenario more infrequent:\n",
    "* have page daemon continually write dirty pages to disk (cleans them)\n",
    "* ensuring the number of clean pages are above a certain threshold\n",
    "* **reimplement stack allocation to get stack pages on demand. Otherwise you'll be deprived of memory so fast**\n",
    "    * You'll need to do this anyway. Do this early on. Instead of allocating the stack right away, let the programs hit vm_faults \n",
    "\n",
    "### How else could kernel evict the page?\n",
    "Delegate the IO wait to another thread. The kernel thread busywaits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously this sucks because busywaiting is trash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a user program in this scenario:\n",
    "* user program TBL fault\n",
    "* kernel vm_fault, page not in memory, need clean page\n",
    "* kernel spinlocks coremap\n",
    "\n",
    "You're lucky here! You know the vm_fault could not have any spinlocks! You got here through the trap! \n",
    "\n",
    "This means you can just chuck the page writing to another thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set a busybit (eg. reference count) on a page and then release the coremap spinlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Page Daemon scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Page daemon just hangs around and evicts things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Same thing. Release the lock. Use the busybit to mark what you're transferring to swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Kernel scenario is most difficult\n",
    "    * could have spinlocks held from the stack\n",
    "    * no blocking inside kmalloc\n",
    "    * we need to minimize the amount that this happens\n",
    "* User and page daemon scenarios are simpler\n",
    "    * can assume no spinlocks are held\n",
    "    * synchronize the coremap using busybits to avoid locking it up while waiting for IO\n"

    "\n",
