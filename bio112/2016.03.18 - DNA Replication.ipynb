    "\n",
    "Synthesis of the lagging strand results in a shorter DNA strand. This is because we have to have the RNA primer at the very end of the template strand. Removing the RNA primer results in a small section of the daughter strand that was not replicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telomerase **extends the template strand** so that primase can bind beyond the entire strand. Then DNA polymerase can replicate the entire template, including the ends.\n",

    "There is current research that believes that aging is the result of this shortening of chromosomes.\n",

    "1. Randomly in nature caused by **unrepaired mistakes in DNA that makes it through two rounds of replication**\n",
    "2. DNA damage from environmental exposure to mutagens, which influence the likelihood of replication errors\n",
