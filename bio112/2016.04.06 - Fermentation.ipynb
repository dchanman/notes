    "# DNP Revisited (Still aerobic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that DNP makes the inner membrane of the mitochondria leaky to $H^+$ ions. What happens?\n",
    "* ETC (electron transport chain) goes on overdrive, it tries to continually pump hydrogen ions out but to no avail\n",
    "* This burns more glucose in order to continually try to burn glucose\n",
    "* This also increases oxygen consumption since oxygen is the final acceptor in the ETC\n",
    "* Very little ATP will still get produced (substrate-level phosphorylation/glycoysis), but the majority of ATP production ceases (from oxydative-level phosphorylation)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Symptoms of DNP Treatment\n",
    "All of the lost energy goes into heat\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cataracts: denatured proteins in eye\n",

    "What is the difference between fermentation and anerobic respiration?\n",
    "* Anaerobic uses inorganic molecules in terminal electron acceptor (TEA), fermentation uses organic\n",
    "* Anerobic respiration involves electron transport chain (ETC), fermentation does not\n",
    "* Anaerobic results in large energy production, fermentation results in little\n",
    "* Anaerobic involves membrane bound proteins, fermentation in all parts of cytoplasm\n",

    "*Oxidizes NADH to NAD+*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the whole point. We need to have NAD+ again to feed back into glycolysis. Fermentation pathways try to keep the glycolysis path churning. Lactate is the carbon byproduct of the whole operation.\n",

    "## Examples of fermentation pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wine is a bunch of squished grapes with a tiny bit of yeast. This is ethanol fermentation, for plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Animals and bacteria experience lactic acid fermentation. **Pyruvate** is the electron acceptor in this case. It receives electrons and becomes reduced to form lactic acid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our byproducts ethanol and lactic acid still have a lot of potential energy. We waste this!"
